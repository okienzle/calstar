This project aims to develop a review and informational platform where UC Berkeley students can submit unmoderated reviews and ratings for courses and professors while also sharing supporting documents like past syllabi, textbooks, and study resources. The system will feature a searchable database, user authentication, and content moderation tools to ensure constructive feedback.
